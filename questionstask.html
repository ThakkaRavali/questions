    <h2 id="home">home</h2>
    <p>Home" refers to a place of residence, typically where one lives with family or loved ones. It can be a house, apartment, condo, or any other structure considered a dwelling. Beyond the physical structure, home also encompasses a sense of belonging, comfort, security, and a place to build memories.</p>
    <h2 id="Services">services</h2>
    <p> big building with many levels and apartments is called "a block of flats" (British) or an apartment building. One of the differences between a house and an apartment is that a house has a front door to the outside world, whereas the main door of an apartment usually opens onto a passage or landing that can be used by other people in the building.</p>
    <h2 id="about">about</h2>
    <p>Houses have a roof to keep off the rain and sun, and walls to keep out the wind and cold. They have window openings to let in light, and a floor. Houses of different places may look different to each other, because of different materials, climate, and styles.</p>
    <h2 id="contact"></h2>
    <p>A tiny house is one that's usually 500sqft / 48sqm in size and typically built on a trailer or barge and thus portable. Tiny houses can also be built on smaller versions of conventional foundations.</p>
